# Relational Database Implementation

I took CS186 Introduction to Database Systems as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley in 2017.
However, the class iteration I took abstracted out the need to understand some parts of the database (e.g.
I implemented the B+ tree and joins, but not the lock manager). The 2023 iteration of the 
class is significantly better, plus I wanted to revisit and solidify my understanding of the subject
anyway (now that I have attained more mathematical/computer science maturity).

## Update and Final Verdict

Decided to desist and deprecate. I am not really a computer scientist, even though I like software. Did not see point in hundred percent learning it without building on top of it or deepening it afterwards.
